I've been working as a librarian in old national library for quite a while. And as part of my job I was tasked to catalog books and documents in the collection of national archives that have long been forgotten. Upon one day I stumbled upon an old book full of what appeared to be hand written manuscripts with ink drawings of weird creatures. Almost runic like text drew me in so much I took it to study. This is where I learned about [[The will]] and although at first I dismissed it as rambles of some crazy person, something persuaded me to try to summon a familiar which with some preparation I deemed like fun project. Upon reading the spell the page burst in flames and crystals I had gathered dissipated into a fog which swirled around forming a small catlike creature. I panicked thinking the book was going to destroy itself yet it seemed unscathed, aside from the missing page. When the dust settled I suddenly felt all energy drain out of me and I passed out.
