Game is supposed to be board game and synergy oriented.
Game is played on a hexagonal board where hero is a piece like king in chess.
Pieces attack same way they move, returning to initial tile if target survives, and taking space of the enemy if it dies. (This rule can be override by the card) initial idea is that there's general mana (sort of like white in magic) which starts at 2 and increments each turn by 1 until some nice number like 10, or 12. There are also other kinds of mana like resources which are saved between each turn gathered from specific cards. Main win condition is bringing enemy's hero's health to 0.
-No card should win, or carry the game on it's own.
-No card should counter all strategies on it's own.
-There should be cards which give incentive to changing current strategy, they should be rare for example singletons.
-Powerful effects shouldn't be attached to big stated minions, as to make playing them on right tile feel important.
